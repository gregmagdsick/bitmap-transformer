# bitmap-transformer

For this project, I worked with Rachel Burke, Phillip Nguyen, Shelly Yusuf and James Norton.

***To Run***
on the command line, from the base directory, type 'node lib/bitmapTransformer.js [image] [transformType]'

where [image] is the name of the image, and [transformType] is either 'invert' or 'grayscale', depending on which transform you want to do.
